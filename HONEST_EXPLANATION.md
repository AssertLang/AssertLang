# The Honest Truth About Promptware (Current State)

## What I Told You vs. What Actually Happens

### What I Said:
> "You say 'Create a web service that responds Hello World' and Promptware figures it out!"

### What Actually Happens:
**Promptware ignores what you wrote and returns a hardcoded template.**

---

## The Real Code

Look at `daemon/mcpd.py` line 175:

```python
def plan_create_v1(self, prompt: str, lang: str = "python") -> dict:
    # Minimal deterministic plan for Hello World Flask
    if lang == "python":
        plan = {
            "files": [{
                "path": "app.py",
                "content": (
                    "import os\n"
                    "from http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler, HTTPServer\n\n"
                    "class Handler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):\n"
                    "    def do_GET(self):\n"
                    "        self.send_response(200)\n"
                    "        # ... hardcoded 'Hello, World!' response\n"
                )
            }],
            "start": "python app.py",
        }
```

**The `prompt` parameter (your text) is completely ignored.**

It doesn't matter if you write:
- "Create a web service that responds 'Hello, World!'"
- "Build me a spaceship"
- "asdfghjkl"
- "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"

**You get the exact same hardcoded Python web server.**

---

## So What's the Point?

### This is a **Framework**, Not a Working System

Think of it like building a car:

**Wave 1-2 (NOW)**:
- ✅ We built the engine (DSL interpreter)
- ✅ We built the wheels (runners for Python/Node/Go/Rust/.NET)
- ✅ We built the transmission (tool adapters)
- ✅ We built the dashboard (timeline events)
- ❌ **We have NO steering wheel (natural language understanding)**

The car runs. But it only goes straight to one destination (hardcoded Hello World).

---

## Where MCP Fits In (The Vision)

**MCP** = Model Context Protocol

This is Anthropic's protocol for connecting AI models (like Claude) to tools and systems.

### The Plan (Wave 4):

1. **You write**: "Create a web service that responds 'Hello, World!'"

2. **MCP sends this to Claude** (an actual LLM)

3. **Claude understands** your request and generates a Promptware DSL plan:
   ```
   lang python
   start python app.py

   file app.py:
     from flask import Flask
     app = Flask(__name__)

     @app.route('/')
     def hello():
         return 'Hello, World!'
   ```

4. **Promptware interpreter** (the thing we built) executes that plan

5. **Runners** (also built) actually run the code

### Current State:

**Steps 1-3 are MISSING.** We jump straight to step 4 with a hardcoded plan.

---

## What Actually Works Today

### The DSL Interpreter

If you write a **Promptware DSL file** (not natural language), the system can execute it:

```
lang python
start python app.py

file app.py:
  from flask import Flask
  app = Flask(__name__)

dep python requirements flask==2.3.3

tool rest.get as fetch

call fetch as resp url="https://api.example.com" expect.status=200
if ${resp.data.count} > 10:
  call notify message="High volume"
else:
  call notify message="Low volume"
```

**This works!** The interpreter:
- Parses the DSL
- Writes the files
- Installs dependencies
- Executes tool calls
- Handles conditionals
- Emits timeline events

But **you have to write the DSL manually**. No natural language understanding.

---

## The Two Paths Forward

### Option 1: Add an LLM (The MCP Vision)

```
User Input (Natural Language)
    ↓
Claude/LLM via MCP Protocol
    ↓
Generates Promptware DSL
    ↓
Interpreter Executes It
    ↓
Runners Run It
    ↓
Working Application
```

**Pros**: True natural language understanding
**Cons**: Requires LLM, costs money, adds latency

---

### Option 2: Smart Pattern Matching (No LLM)

Use heuristics and templates:
- Detect "web service" → Use web server template
- Detect "API call to X" → Use HTTP client template
- Detect "save to file" → Use file writer template

**Pros**: Fast, free, deterministic
**Cons**: Limited to known patterns, not truly intelligent

---

## What We Built in Wave 2

We built **everything except the brain**:

### ✅ Working Components:

1. **DSL Parser** - Converts DSL text → AST structure
2. **Interpreter** - Executes AST (call, let, if, parallel, fanout, merge, state)
3. **Timeline Events** - Tracks execution flow
4. **Runners** - Python and Node execution environments
5. **Tool Adapters** - Multi-language implementations (Python/Node/Go/Rust/.NET)
6. **Policy System** - Network/filesystem/secrets controls (documented, not enforced)
7. **Python SDK** - For external integrations
8. **Test Infrastructure** - CI/CD with multi-runtime support

### ❌ Missing:

1. **Natural Language Understanding** - The "compiler" that turns English → DSL
2. **LLM Integration** - MCP connection to Claude or other models
3. **Smart Planning** - Figuring out what tools to use for a task

---

## The Honest Demo

### What Works:

```bash
# If you write valid Promptware DSL
cat > my_plan.pw << 'EOF'
lang python
start python app.py

file app.py:
  print("Hello from Promptware!")
EOF

# The interpreter can execute it
promptware run my_plan.pw
```

### What Doesn't Work:

```bash
# If you write natural language
promptware run "Build me a todo app with user authentication"

# Result: You get the same hardcoded Hello World web server
# Because there's no natural language understanding
```

---

## So Why Did We Build This?

### Chicken and Egg Problem

**Option A**: Build NL → DSL compiler first
- Problem: No way to test if the generated DSL is correct
- No execution environment to validate plans

**Option B**: Build execution environment first (what we did)
- ✅ Now we have a working interpreter
- ✅ Now we can test generated plans
- ✅ Now we know what DSL features we need
- Next: Add the NL → DSL compiler

---

## The Real Test (What Actually Passes)

```python
def test_run_hello_world():
    # This passes because:
    result = runner.invoke(mcp_main, ["run", "LITERALLY_ANY_STRING_HERE"])

    # The prompt is ignored
    # System returns hardcoded Python web server
    # Runner executes it
    # Test confirms it returns "Hello, World!"
```

**It's not magic. It's a working execution engine with a placeholder compiler.**

---

## What Happens in Wave 3-4

### Wave 3: Infrastructure
- Policy enforcement (actually block network/filesystem access)
- Marketplace for sharing tools
- Better error handling

### Wave 4: The Brain
- **Natural Language Compiler**: Prompt → DSL
- **Options**:
  - Connect to Claude via MCP
  - Use local LLM (Llama, Mistral)
  - Use smart heuristics/templates
  - Hybrid: Templates + LLM fallback

---

## The Bottom Line

### What Promptware Is Today:
A **very sophisticated execution engine** for running multi-language plans with observability, but with **no brain** to generate those plans from natural language.

### What Promptware Will Be:
A complete system where you describe what you want and it figures out how to build and run it.

### The Gap:
We need a **compiler** (LLM or otherwise) that turns:
```
"Create a web service that responds 'Hello, World!'"
```

Into:
```
lang python
start python app.py

file app.py:
  from http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler, HTTPServer
  class Handler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
      def do_GET(self):
          self.send_response(200)
          self.wfile.write(b'Hello, World!')
  HTTPServer(('127.0.0.1', 8000), Handler).serve_forever()
```

**That's the missing piece.**

## MCP's Role (When We Add It)

**MCP** = Model Context Protocol (Anthropic's standard)

```
┌─────────────────┐
│ Your Prompt     │  "Build a todo app"
└────────┬────────┘
         │
         v
┌─────────────────┐
│ MCP Client      │  Formats request for Claude
└────────┬────────┘
         │
         v
┌─────────────────┐
│ Claude (LLM)    │  Generates Promptware DSL
└────────┬────────┘
         │
         v
┌─────────────────┐
│ Promptware      │  Executes the DSL (this exists!)
│ Interpreter     │
└────────┬────────┘
         │
         v
┌─────────────────┐
│ Running App     │
└─────────────────┘
```

**Status**: Everything except "Claude generates DSL" is built.

## The Misleading Test Name

The test is called `test_run_hello_world()` but it should be called:

**`test_hardcoded_hello_world_template_with_dynamic_execution()`**

Because that's what it actually tests.

---

## Final Honest Assessment

**Impressive**:
- Complete multi-language execution framework
- Timeline observability
- Tool adapter generation
- Runner protocol
- Test infrastructure

**Not Impressive**:
- Zero natural language understanding
- Hardcoded templates pretending to be intelligent
- No actual "prompt" to "ware" conversion happening

**But**:
- We built the hard part first (execution engine)
- Adding the LLM/compiler is the easy part (it's just an API call to Claude)
- We validated the DSL design works

---

## What You Should Tell People

**Don't say**: "Promptware turns natural language into running code!"

**Do say**: "Promptware is an execution framework for running multi-language plans with observability. Natural language compilation coming in Wave 4."

**Or**: "It's like Docker + Kubernetes, but for AI-generated code. We built the runtime; LLM integration coming next."

---

## Can We Demo Something Real?

### Yes - The DSL Interpreter:

```bash
# Write actual Promptware DSL
cat > demo.pw << 'EOF'
lang python
start python app.py

file app.py:
  import requests
  r = requests.get('https://api.github.com/repos/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-python')
  print(f"Stars: {r.json()['stargazers_count']}")

dep python requirements requests
EOF

# This will actually work when we hook up the interpreter
# (Currently only the MVP hello-world path is wired up)
```

**This is real functionality. Just needs the proper CLI integration.**

---

**TL;DR**: We built a Ferrari engine with no steering wheel. It runs great in a straight line (hardcoded templates). In Wave 4, we'll add the steering wheel (LLM/compiler) so you can actually drive it anywhere.
