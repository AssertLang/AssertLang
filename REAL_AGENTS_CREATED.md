# REAL Claude Code Agents Created

**Date**: 2025-10-14
**Session**: Post-Session 51
**Status**: âœ… **COMPLETE** - 7 Real Claude Code Agents Operational

**Total**: 63.0 KB of agent definitions

### Documentation

- `README.md` (9.7 KB) - Complete usage guide
- `CLAUDE_CODE_AGENT_ARCHITECTURE.md` (600+ lines) - Full architecture document
- `SESSION_52_AGENT_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Session summary

## Agent Definition Format

Each agent is a Markdown file with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: agent-name
description: Brief description
tools: Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep, Bash, WebFetch
model: sonnet
---

# Agent Name

System prompt with:
- Expertise domain
- Mission statement
- Deliverables
- Testing protocol
- Coordination dependencies
- Files owned
- Research sources
- Example task flows
- Exit criteria
```

## Key Features

### 1. Real Claude Code Integration

These are not simulations - they are actual Claude Code subagents:

```
# Automatic delegation
You: "Add async/await to stdlib"
Claude: [Automatically routes to stdlib-engineer]

# Explicit invocation
/agent stdlib-engineer "Implement Future<T>"

# View all agents
/agents
```

### 2. Tool Access

Each agent has appropriate tool access:
- `Read` - Read files
- `Write` - Create files
- `Edit` - Modify files
- `Glob` - Find files by pattern
- `Grep` - Search file contents
- `Bash` - Run commands
- `WebFetch` - Fetch web content
- `WebSearch` - Search the web (where needed)

### 3. Deep Expertise

Each agent has detailed system prompts covering:

**stdlib-engineer**:
- Type systems (generics, enums, traits)
- Stdlib API design (Rust patterns)
- Pattern matching (syntax + codegen)
- World-class documentation
- Current work: 1,027 lines stdlib complete

**runtime-engineer**:
- VM architecture (bytecode, stack, heap)
- Capability-based security
- Async/await execution
- CLI design (pw build/run/test)
- Research topics: Lua VM, Tokio, Joe-E

**codegen-specialist**:
- Multi-language codegen (Python âœ…, Rust, Go, JS)
- Pattern matching per language
- Conformance testing
- FFI implementation
- Current: Python 100%, Rust 10%, Go 5%, JS 15%

**devtools-engineer**:
- LSP server (completion, hover, goto, diagnostics)
- VS Code extension
- Code formatter (AST-based)
- Static linter
- Research: rust-analyzer, Black, ESLint

**qa-engineer**:
- Test framework (discovery, execution, coverage)
- Benchmarking (vs Python/Rust/Go/JS)
- Package manager (`pwpm` like cargo/npm)
- RFC process (governance)
- Quality dashboard

**release-engineer**:
- Security auditing (capability bypasses)

- Stdlib operation binding
- Client libraries
- Operation marketplace

## How to Use

### Invoke Agent Explicitly

```bash
# Via command
/agent runtime-engineer "Research VM vs transpiler decision"

# Via chat
You: "Spawn runtime-engineer to build the CLI tool"
Claude: [Spawns runtime-engineer with context]
```

### Automatic Delegation

Claude will automatically route tasks to appropriate agents:

```
You: "Implement Rust pattern matching"
Claude: [Detects this is codegen work, routes to codegen-specialist]

codegen-specialist:
- Researching Rust match expressions
- Implementing IRPatternMatch â†’ match translation
- Testing 30 pattern combinations
- All tests passing
- Generated code compiles with rustc
```

### Multi-Agent Coordination

```
You: "Prepare for v2.3.0 release"

Claude: [Coordinates multiple agents]

qa-engineer: Running 302+ tests
release-engineer: Security audit + fuzzing
stdlib-engineer: Checking for regressions
codegen-specialist: Conformance tests

[All agents report green]

Claude: Ready to release. Run: scripts/release.sh v2.3.0
```

## Advantages Over Old Approach

### Old Approach (TA Folders)

```
.claude/Task Agent 1/
  context.json          # Manual status tracking
  mission.md            # Static document
  dependencies.yml      # Manual management
```

**Problems**:
- Manual coordination
- No real delegation
- File-based simulation
- Lead agent overhead

### New Approach (Real Agents)

```
.claude/agents/
  stdlib-engineer.md    # Real Claude agent
  runtime-engineer.md   # Auto-invocable
  codegen-specialist.md # Self-managing
```

**Benefits**:
- Real AI delegation
- Automatic routing
- Self-documenting
- Parallel execution
- True specialization

## Quality Standards

All agents follow **No-BS Engineering**:
- Blunt, technical, factual communication
- Real implementations (no placeholders)
- 100% test coverage required
- All APIs documented
- Performance benchmarked

## Agent Coordination

### Dependency Graph

```
stdlib-engineer (âœ… complete: 134/134 tests)
  â†“
runtime-engineer (needs executable stdlib)
  â†“
devtools-engineer (needs CLI integration)
qa-engineer (needs runtime for benchmarks)
codegen-specialist (needs stdlib IR)
  â†“
release-engineer (needs all for CI/CD)

mcp-specialist (independent, 23 ops working)
```

### Coordination Mechanisms

- **Shared Context**: All agents read project state
- **Dependency Awareness**: Agents know what they need
- **Status Updates**: Agents report progress
- **Quality Gates**: All work must pass tests

## Current Status

### Completed Agents (2/7)

**stdlib-engineer** âœ…:
- 1,027 lines stdlib (Option, Result, List, Map, Set)
- 134/134 tests passing (100%)
- Pattern matching working
- Production-ready for Python

**mcp-specialist** âœ…:
