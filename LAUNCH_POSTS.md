**Title:** AssertLang – Executable contracts for multi-agent systems

**Post:**

We built AssertLang to solve a problem we kept hitting: agents from different frameworks (CrewAI, LangGraph, AutoGen) couldn't coordinate reliably. Two agents implementing the "same" task would produce different results.

The issue isn't messaging protocols (MCP, A2A, ACP handle that). It's semantic contracts - ensuring agents execute identical business logic regardless of framework or language.

**The solution:**

Define behavior once in AL:
```al
function createUser(name: string, email: string) -> User {
    if (str.length(name) < 1) {
        return ValidationError("name", "Name cannot be empty");
    }
    // ... rest of logic
}
```

Transpile to any framework/language:
```bash
asl build contract.al --lang python -o crewai_agent.py
asl build contract.al --lang javascript -o langgraph_agent.js
```

Result: Guaranteed identical behavior. We've proven this with CrewAI (Python) and LangGraph (JavaScript) producing 100% identical outputs across all test cases.

**Technical details:**
- Transpiles to Python, JavaScript, Go, Rust, C#
- Full standard library (Option, Result, List, Map, Set)
- Pattern matching, generics, type safety
- 302/302 tests passing
- MIT licensed

**Use cases:**
1. Multi-framework coordination (Python + JavaScript teams)
2. Framework migration (move from CrewAI to LangGraph safely)
3. Enterprise multi-agent systems (consistency across 10+ agents)

**Title:** [P] AssertLang: Executable contracts for multi-agent coordination

**Post:**

**Problem:** Multi-agent systems can't coordinate reliably. Agents from different frameworks (CrewAI, LangGraph, AutoGen) interpret the "same" task differently, leading to inconsistent behavior.

**Solution:** AssertLang - executable contracts that transpile to any language/framework while guaranteeing identical behavior.

**How it works:**

1. Define behavior once in AL (deterministic contract language)
2. Transpile to Python, JavaScript, Go, Rust, or C#
3. Agents execute identical logic regardless of framework

**Example:**

```al
// contract.al
function createUser(name: string, email: string) -> User {
    if (str.length(name) < 1) {
        return ValidationError("name", "Required");
    }
    // ... deterministic logic
}
```

```bash
# Generate for CrewAI (Python)
asl build contract.al --lang python

# Generate for LangGraph (JavaScript)
asl build contract.al --lang javascript
```

**Result:** Both agents produce IDENTICAL outputs (verified with 100% match across all test cases).

**Why this matters:**
- Enables cross-framework coordination
- Safe framework migration
- Consistent behavior in enterprise systems
- Single source of truth for agent logic

**Technical:**
- Full standard library (134/134 tests passing)
- Pattern matching, generics, type safety
- CLI tools for build/compile/run/validate/test
- VS Code extension
- 302/302 total tests passing
- MIT licensed, open source

- PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/assertlang/0.0.3/
- Proof of determinism: https://github.com/AssertLang/AssertLang/blob/main/examples/agent_coordination/PROOF_OF_DETERMINISM.md

**Install:**
```bash
pip install assertlang==0.0.3
```

Looking for feedback and contributors!

## Reddit r/Python

**Title:** AssertLang: Write once, run on any AI agent framework (CrewAI, LangGraph, AutoGen)

**Post:**

I built AssertLang to solve coordination issues between Python agents (CrewAI) and JavaScript agents (LangGraph).

**The problem:** Two agents implementing the "same" spec produce different results because they interpret requirements differently.

**The solution:** Define behavior once in AL, transpile to Python/JavaScript, guarantee identical execution.

**Example:**

```al
// hello.al
function greet(name: string) -> string {
    if (str.length(name) < 1) {
        return "Hello, Guest!";
    }
    return "Hello, " + name + "!";
}
```

```bash
# Generate Python for CrewAI
asl build hello.al --lang python -o agent.py

# Use in CrewAI
from agent import greet
# Guaranteed to match JavaScript/LangGraph agent
```

**Supported targets:**
- Python 3.9+ (CrewAI, AutoGen, LangChain)
- JavaScript/TypeScript (LangGraph, Node.js agents)
- Go, Rust, C# (high-performance agents)

**Features:**
- Type safety with generics
- Pattern matching
- Standard library (Option, Result, List, Map, Set)
- CLI tools
- VS Code extension
- 100% test coverage (302/302 passing)

**Install:**
```bash
pip install assertlang==0.0.3
```

**Links:**
- GitHub: https://github.com/AssertLang/AssertLang
- PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/assertlang/0.0.3/

**Title:** AssertLang: Solving Multi-Agent Coordination in Enterprise AI Systems

**Post:**

Multi-agent AI systems are projected to grow from $5.25B (2024) to $52.62B by 2030, but enterprises face a critical challenge: agents from different frameworks can't coordinate reliably.

I'm excited to share AssertLang, an open-source solution that guarantees deterministic coordination across frameworks and languages.

**The Challenge**

When different teams use different AI frameworks (CrewAI, LangGraph, AutoGen), agents interpret the "same" requirements differently. This leads to:
- Inconsistent validation and errors
- Unpredictable system behavior
- Difficult debugging and maintenance
- Risky framework migrations

**The Solution**

AssertLang introduces executable contracts - define agent behavior once, transpile to any framework/language, guarantee identical execution.

**How It Works**

1. Define behavior in AL (deterministic contract language)
2. Transpile to Python, JavaScript, Go, Rust, or C#
3. Agents execute identical logic regardless of framework

**Proven Results**

We've verified 100% identical outputs between CrewAI (Python) and LangGraph (JavaScript) agents across all test cases. Same validation, same errors, same business logic.

**Enterprise Benefits**

✅ Multi-framework coordination (Python + JavaScript teams)
✅ Safe framework migration without behavior changes
✅ Consistent business logic across 10+ agents
✅ Single source of truth for agent specifications
✅ Reduced testing and maintenance burden

**Technical Foundation**

- Full standard library (Option, Result, List, Map, Set)
- Type safety with generics and pattern matching
- Comprehensive test suite (302/302 passing)
- Professional CLI tools
- VS Code extension
- MIT licensed, community-driven

**Get Started**

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts and use cases!
