## What We're Working On

### Strategic Pivot: Multi-Agent Contracts
**Target Market:** Multi-agent AI developers ($5.25B â†’ $52.62B by 2030)
**Problem Solved:** Agents from different frameworks can't reliably coordinate
**Solution:** AssertLang contracts guarantee deterministic behavior across frameworks

### Current Phase: Phase 1 - Strategic Pivot (Week 1)

**Completed:**
- âœ… Market research and validation
- âœ… Proof-of-concept (100% identical Agent A vs Agent B)
- âœ… README.md rewrite with new positioning
- âœ… Execution plan created (PIVOT_EXECUTION_PLAN.md)
- âœ… Standard library complete (134/134 tests passing)
- âœ… GitHub infrastructure set up
- âœ… Domains acquired

**In Progress:**
- ðŸ”„ CLAUDE.md updates with new vision
- ðŸ”„ Elevator pitch and taglines
- ðŸ”„ Polish agent_coordination example
- ðŸ”„ Update PyPI description

**Next Steps:**
1. Review current uncommitted changes (pyproject.toml)
2. Continue Phase 1 work (polish examples, docs)
3. Move to Phase 2: Core contract language enhancements
