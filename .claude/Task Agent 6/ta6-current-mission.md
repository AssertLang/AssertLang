## Mission: Safety, Reliability, and Release Automation

**Assigned branch:** `feature/pw-safety-release` (create from `upstream/main`)  
**Primary objective:** Deliver production-grade confidence via security hardening, fuzz/stress infrastructure, and automated release pipelines.

### Scope & Deliverables
1. **Capability & Sandbox Auditing**
   - Formalize capability model (`docs/security/CAPABILITY_MODEL.md`) covering fs/net/process/crypto/time.
   - Implement enforcement in runtime (coordinate with TA2) plus policy configuration files.
   - Add integration tests ensuring unauthorized access is blocked by default.
2. **Fuzzing & Stress Framework**
   - Set up fuzz targets for parser, IR lowering, runtime bytecode loader using python-afl/LibFuzzer (or equivalent).
   - Build stress tests for async scheduler (timeouts, cancellation storms) and stdlib I/O (simulate failures).
   - Automate nightly fuzz/stress runs with crash triage scripts.
3. **Continuous Integration Revamp**
   - Author GitHub Actions workflows:
     - `ci/core.yml` – lint + unit tests
     - `ci/tooling.yml` – formatter/LSP/tests
     - `ci/conformance.yml` – run subset of conformance suite
   - Ensure workflows run on PRs and `upstream/main`.
4. **Release Automation**
   - Implement `publish-on-tag.yml` to build wheels, run smoke tests, upload to PyPI, and draft GitHub release notes.
   - Provide rollback plan & scripts (`scripts/release/rollback.sh`).
5. **Observability & Diagnostics**
   - Instrument runtime with metrics/tracing hooks; document integration with logging (TA1) and benchmarking (TA4).
   - Ensure crash reports include source snippet, capability context, and reproduction command.

### Exit Criteria
- Capabilities enforced with documented policies; security regression tests pass.
- Fuzzing infrastructure running regularly with dashboard of findings.
- CI pipelines green and mandatory before merge.
- Tagging `vX.Y.Z` triggers automated publish steps with verification gates.
- Diagnostics documentation updated (`docs/diagnostics/DEBUGGING.md`) showing stack traces + log correlation.

### Coordination
- Align with **TA2** (runtime) on capability enforcement hooks.
- Consume test inputs from **TA5** (conformance) for stress/fuzz seeding.
- Collaborate with **TA4** on publishing release automation and observability metrics.
