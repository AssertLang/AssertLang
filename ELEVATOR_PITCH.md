# AssertLang Elevator Pitch

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-14
**Target Audience:** Multi-agent AI developers, framework integrators, VCs

---

## The 30-Second Pitch

**AssertLang provides executable contracts for multi-agent systems.**

Write contracts once in PW. Agents from different frameworks (CrewAI, LangGraph, AutoGen) execute identical logic. Deterministic coordination across languages and frameworks—guaranteed.

No more behavior drift. No more integration nightmares. Just reliable multi-agent coordination.

---

## The 2-Minute Pitch

**The Problem:**

The multi-agent AI market is exploding—$5.25B today, $52.62B by 2030. But agents can't reliably coordinate.

Two agents trying to work together? They interpret tasks differently. One validates email one way, the other validates differently. Different frameworks, different languages, different behavior. The result? Systems that drift, break, and fail unpredictably.

Existing solutions like MCP, A2A, and ACP handle messaging—but NOT semantic contracts. There's no way to guarantee agents will behave identically.

**The Solution:**

AssertLang solves this with executable contracts. Write your contract once in PW—define validation rules, business logic, error handling. Transpile to Python, JavaScript, Rust, Go, C#.

Agents from different frameworks execute IDENTICAL logic. Same input → same output. Always. Across languages, across frameworks, across execution environments.

**The Proof:**

We built a working prototype. Agent A (Python/CrewAI) and Agent B (JavaScript/LangGraph) both implement the same PW contract. Same input, same output—100% match on all tests. Same IDs, same validation errors, same everything.

**The Market:**

- $52B market by 2030
- No existing solution for deterministic contracts
- Every multi-agent framework needs this
- Open source (MIT) for maximum adoption

**The Ask:**

Star us on GitHub. Try it in your multi-agent system. Help us integrate with your framework.

## The 5-Minute Pitch (For Technical Audiences)

**Background:**

Multi-agent AI systems are the future. CrewAI, LangGraph, AutoGen, LangChain—all building agents that coordinate to solve complex tasks. But coordination is fragile.

**Current State:**

When Agent A (Python) and Agent B (JavaScript) need to coordinate:

**Agent A decides:**
```python
if not name:
    raise ValueError("Missing name")
```

**Agent B decides:**
```javascript
if (name === "") {
    throw new Error("Name is required");
}
```

Different validation. Different errors. Inconsistent behavior. System breaks.

**What Doesn't Work:**

- **Natural language**: Too ambiguous, LLMs interpret differently
- **JSON Schema**: Types only, no business logic
- **MCP/A2A/ACP**: Messaging protocols, not semantic contracts
- **LLM interpretation**: Non-deterministic, unreliable

**What DOES Work:**

**Executable contracts in PW:**

```pw
function createUser(name: string, email: string) -> User {
    if (str.length(name) < 1) {
        return ValidationError("name", "Name cannot be empty");
    }

    if (!str.contains(email, "@")) {
        return ValidationError("email", "Invalid email format");
    }

    let id = str.length(name) + str.length(email);
    return User(id, name, email, timestamp());
}
```

**Transpile to Python:**
```bash
asl build contract.al --lang python -o agent_a.py
```

**Transpile to JavaScript:**
```bash
asl build contract.al --lang javascript -o agent_b.js
```

**Result:** Both agents execute IDENTICAL logic. Deterministic coordination.

**Technical Architecture:**

1. **Contract Parser** - Parse PW syntax
2. **Semantic Analysis** - Extract business rules, validation logic
3. **Multi-Language Codegen** - Generate idiomatic code for each language
4. **Behavioral Equivalence** - Guarantee same semantics across all targets

**Framework Integration:**

- **CrewAI (Python)**: Contracts as agent tools
- **LangGraph (JavaScript)**: Contracts as graph nodes
- **AutoGen (Python)**: Contracts as agent functions
- **Custom frameworks**: Just import generated code

**Validation:**

Real working example: `examples/agent_coordination/`

| Test Case | Agent A (Python) | Agent B (JavaScript) | Match |
|-----------|------------------|---------------------|-------|
| Valid user | User #28 | User #28 | ✅ |
| Empty name | "Name cannot be empty" | "Name cannot be empty" | ✅ |
| Invalid email | false | false | ✅ |
| Valid email | true | true | ✅ |
| Framework integration | id=24 | id=24 | ✅ |

**Success Rate: 5/5 (100%)**

## FAQ

**Q: How is this different from MCP?**
A: MCP handles tool calling for LLMs. PW handles semantic contracts for agent coordination. They're complementary—you can expose PW contracts as MCP tools.

**Q: How is this different from JSON Schema?**
A: JSON Schema defines types. PW defines behavior—validation rules, business logic, error handling. Full executable semantics.

**Q: Why not just use natural language?**
A: Natural language is ambiguous. LLMs interpret differently. PW contracts are deterministic—same input always produces same output.

**Q: What frameworks do you support?**
A: Currently: CrewAI (Python), LangGraph (JavaScript). Coming soon: AutoGen, LangChain. Plus any custom framework—just import the generated code.

**Q: What languages can you transpile to?**
A: Production-ready: Python, JavaScript. Beta: Rust, Go, C#. All with 100% semantic equivalence.

**Q: Is this production-ready?**
A: The transpiler is production-ready (134/134 tests passing). Framework integrations are in active development. Proof-of-concept is working.

**Q: What's the license?**
A: MIT. Completely open source. Use it anywhere, modify it, integrate it. No restrictions.

**Q: How do I get started?**
A: `pip install assertlang`, write a contract, transpile to your language, use in your agent. Full guide in 5 minutes.
