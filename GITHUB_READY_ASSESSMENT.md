## ⚠️ Minor Items (Non-Blocking)

### Internal Documentation
Some internal documentation files still reference "Promptware":
- `docs/promptware-dsl-spec.md`
- `docs/promptware-tech.md`
- Various session summaries

**Impact:** LOW - These are internal/archived docs
**Priority:** Can update incrementally
**User-facing:** All user-facing docs use "AssertLang" ✅

### Archived Files
Many historical files in root directory (PHASE_X_COMPLETE.md, etc.)

**Recommendation:** Move to `.archive/` directory for cleaner root
**Priority:** Low - doesn't affect functionality
**Can do:** After going public, clean incrementally
