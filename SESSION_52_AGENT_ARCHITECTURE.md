### Agent Roster

| Agent | Professional Role | Mission | Status |
|-------|------------------|---------|--------|
| **Lead Agent** | Compiler Architect | Orchestration, research, integration, releases | Active |
| **TA1** | Language Engineer #1 | Standard Library & Language Features | ✅ COMPLETE (Session 51) |
| **TA2** | Language Engineer #2 | Runtime & Execution Model (VM, CLI) | Ready to start |
| **TA3** | DevTools Engineer | Developer Experience (LSP, VS Code, formatter) | Ready to start |
| **TA4** | Test/QA Engineer | Quality, Ecosystem, Package Manager | Ready to start |

| **TA6** | Release Engineer | CI/CD, Security, Fuzzing, Automation | Ready to start |
| **TA7** | MCP Specialist | Operations Discovery & Multi-Language Integration | ✅ OPERATIONAL (Session 50) |

### Key Architecture Principles

1. **Specialization**: Each agent has deep expertise in one domain
2. **Autonomy**: Agents work in isolated branches with clear missions
3. **Coordination**: Lead Agent orchestrates through dependency management
4. **Quality**: All work must pass tests + docs + benchmarks
5. **Research-Driven**: Lead Agent researches before spawning agents
6. **User-Focused**: User interacts only with Lead Agent

### Agent Coordination Matrix

| Agent | Blocks | Blocked By | Coordinates With |
|-------|--------|------------|------------------|
| **Lead** | None | None | All TAs |
| **TA1** | TA2, TA3, TA4 | TA7 (parser) ✅ | TA5 (codegen), TA7 |
| **TA2** | TA3, TA4, TA6 | TA1 (stdlib) ✅ | TA3 (CLI), TA6 (fuzzing) |
| **TA3** | None | TA1 ✅, TA2 | TA2 (CLI), TA4 (tests) |
| **TA4** | None | TA1 ✅, TA2, TA3 | TA3 (test runner), TA6 (CI) |
| **TA5** | Deployment | TA1 (stdlib) ✅ | TA1 (IR), TA7 (MCP) |
| **TA6** | Production | TA2 (VM), TA4 (tests) | TA2 (fuzzing), TA4 (CI) |

## Lead Agent Responsibilities

**Research Before Implementation**:
- Conduct deep research before major features
- Document findings in `.claude/research/`
- Give agents research-backed specifications

**Coordination**:
- Spawn agents with full context (mission, expertise, dependencies)
- Monitor progress via context.json
- Integrate completed work
- Manage dependency graph

**Automation Scripts** (Lead Agent uses):
- `scripts/check_status.sh` - Check all TA status
- `scripts/check_deps.sh` - Analyze critical path
- `scripts/update_status.py` - Sync status files
- `scripts/create_ta.sh N "Name" "branch"` - Bootstrap new TA
- `scripts/release.sh vX.Y.Z` - Full release automation

**Quality Gates**:
1. Tests: 100% pass (no skips, no failures)
2. Documentation: All APIs documented
3. Benchmarks: No regressions
4. Security: Capability audit passes
5. Code Review: Lead agent approves

## Communication Protocol

- **User → Lead Agent**: User describes goals
- **Lead Agent → Task Agents**: Spawns with full context
- **Task Agents → Lead Agent**: Report completion + metrics
- **Task Agents ↔ Task Agents**: No direct communication (all through Lead)

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Current | Agent |
|--------|--------|---------|-------|
| Test Coverage | 100% | 100% (302/302) | TA4 |
| Stdlib Tests | 100% | 100% (134/134) | TA1 |
| Python Codegen | 100% | 100% | TA5 |
| Rust Codegen | 100% | 10% | TA5 |
| Go Codegen | 100% | 5% | TA5 |
| JS Codegen | 100% | 15% | TA5 |
| LSP Features | 6/6 | 0/6 | TA3 |
| Package Registry | Operational | Not started | TA4 |
| CI/CD | Automated | Manual | TA6 |
| MCP Operations | 50+ | 23 | TA7 |

## Next Actions

**Immediate** (Lead Agent):
1. ✅ Document agent architecture
2. ✅ Update Current_Work.md
3. ⏳ Spawn TA2 (Runtime & VM) - unblocked by TA1 completion
4. ⏳ Spawn TA5 (Codegen) for Rust/Go/JS generators
5. ⏳ Spawn TA3 (DevTools) for LSP server

**User Decision Points**:
- TA2: VM vs transpiler-only (requires research + benchmarking)
- TA3: LSP features priority (completion first? goto-def first?)
- TA4: Package registry hosting (GitHub? Self-hosted?)
- TA6: CI provider (GitHub Actions? GitLab CI?)
