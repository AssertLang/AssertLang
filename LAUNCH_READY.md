## 📝 PyPI Version Note

**Current State:**
- v0.0.3 is published and working: ✅
- v3.0.0 (incorrect version) still exists but users won't hit it
- All docs use explicit version: `pip install assertlang==0.0.3`

**Optional Cleanup (can do later):**
To yank v3.0.0 manually:
1. Visit: https://pypi.org/manage/project/assertlang/release/3.0.0/
2. Login to PyPI
3. Click "Options" → "Delete release" or "Yank release"
4. Reason: "Incorrect version number, use 0.0.3"

**Impact:** Low priority - users install with explicit version `==0.0.3` so they won't encounter v3.0.0.
