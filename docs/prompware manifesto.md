Promptware Manifesto (High-Impact Overview)

What is Promptware?

Promptware is a new programming paradigm where software is prompted, not programmed. Instead of writing code, users and AI agents express intent in natural language. Promptware turns those prompts into ephemeral applications: generated on demand, validated automatically, and spun down when their job is done.

Think of it as just-in-time software: bespoke tools created exactly when needed, living at Port 23456 — the one port you’ll never forget.

Why It Matters
	•	One Port, Five Verbs, Infinite Apps → a universal micro-language for software generation.
	•	Ephemeral by Default → software is no longer permanent clutter; it’s fluid, disposable, and always fresh.
	•	Agent-Native → designed for AI to code in place, delivering live, user-specific software.
	•	Proof-Oriented → every app comes with artifacts, logs, and validation.

The Future

Promptware defines a new category — ephemeral, agent-generated software. It’s as simple as five verbs and as universal as language itself. One prompt in, one working app out. The future of software is here, and it’s ephemeral.
