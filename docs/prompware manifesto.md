Promptware Manifesto (High-Impact Overview)

What is Promptware?

Promptware is a domain-specific language (.pw) for writing language-agnostic software. Instead of writing language-specific code in Python, Node, Go, Rust, or .NET, you write once in .pw and target any backend language. Think SQL for databases, Terraform for infrastructure, Promptware for multi-language execution.

Your .pw code compiles to Python, Node, Go, Rust, or .NET — same source, different targets. Ephemeral applications generated on demand, validated automatically, and spun down when their job is done.

Think of it as just-in-time, language-agnostic software: write once, run anywhere, living at Port 23456 — the one port you'll never forget.

Why It Matters
	•	One Port, Five Verbs, Infinite Apps → a universal DSL for multi-language execution.
	•	Language-Agnostic → write .pw once, compile to Python, Node, Go, Rust, or .NET.
	•	Ephemeral by Default → software is no longer permanent clutter; it's fluid, disposable, and always fresh.
	•	Agent-Native → designed for AI agents to write and execute .pw code via MCP protocol.
	•	Proof-Oriented → every app comes with artifacts, logs, and validation.

	•	Port 23456: One Port to Rule Them All.
	•	Promptware: One Language, Eight Backends.

The Future

Promptware defines a new category — language-agnostic, ephemeral execution. It's as simple as five verbs and as universal as SQL. Write .pw once, run in any language. The future of software is portable, ephemeral, and language-agnostic.

Optional Enhancement (Wave 4): Natural language → .pw compilation via LLM integration, enabling "prompt in, .pw code out" for AI agents.
