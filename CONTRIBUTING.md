# Contributing to AssertLang

Hey! Thanks for considering contributing to AssertLang. Seriously, it means a lot. 🙏

## 👋 First Things First

I'm David, and I'm building this mostly solo (with a lot of AI assistance). **I'm not a "real" software engineer** - I'm a broadcast tech who saw a problem and decided to build something.

What this means for you:
- **Your contributions are genuinely valuable** - I can't do this alone
- **Don't be intimidated** - if I can contribute, you definitely can
- **Ask questions** - there are no stupid questions here
- **Be honest** - tell me what's broken, what's confusing, what sucks

## 🎯 Ways to Contribute

### 1. 🐛 Report Bugs - Just tell me what broke!
### 2. 💡 Suggest Features - What would make this useful for you?
### 3. 📚 Improve Documentation - Fix typos, clarify explanations
### 4. 🔧 Write Code - Fork, fix, PR (or ask first for big changes)
### 5. 🧪 Test & Give Feedback - Try it and tell me what you think

**Not sure what to work on?** Check issues tagged `good-first-issue` or just ask!
