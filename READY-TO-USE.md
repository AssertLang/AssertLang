# Promptware is Ready to Use

**Status: Complete and tested. All documentation in place.**

---

## What Just Happened

Promptware polish phase is complete. Everything works.

**Completed:**
- HTTP transport verified end-to-end
- All 25+ tests passing (18 generator + 7 HTTP transport)
- CLI `--yes` flag added for automation
- Complete documentation suite created
- AI agent onboarding guide ready

---

## Start Here

```bash
cd /Users/hustlermain/HUSTLER_CONTENT/HSTLR/DEV/Promptware
pip install -e .
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key-here"
promptware --version
```

**Then read:** `FOR-DAVE.md` - Your personal usage guide

## Documentation Map

**For You (Dave):**
- `START-HERE.md` - Entry point with all paths
- `FOR-DAVE.md` - How to use Promptware locally
- `QUICKSTART.md` - 5-minute tutorial

**For AI Coding Agents:**
- `AI-AGENT-GUIDE.md` - Copy/paste this entire file to any AI agent
  - Explains architecture, .pw format, tool system, all commands
  - 700+ lines of comprehensive reference
  - Ready to use immediately

**For Understanding:**
- `PITCH.md` - 5 cool features explained
- `AI-DEVELOPMENT-WORKFLOWS.md` - Real use cases
- `MONETIZATION-STRATEGY.md` - Business strategy (open source recommended)

---

## What Works Right Now

✅ **Core Functionality**
- Create services from .pw files
- Generate in Python, Node.js, Go, C#, Rust
- Run as HTTP APIs or Cursor/IDE tools
- Tool auto-execution (44 tools available)
- Multi-agent service communication

✅ **Transports**
- HTTP (JSON-RPC 2.0) - for microservices
- stdio - for Cursor/Claude integration
- Same .pw file generates both

✅ **Production Ready**
- Health checks (/health, /ready)
- Error handling (JSON-RPC errors)
- Request logging
- MCP protocol compliance
- OpenTelemetry hooks

✅ **Testing**
- 18 generator tests passing
- 7 HTTP transport integration tests passing
- Service-to-service communication verified

## Quick Test (2 Minutes)

```bash
# 1. Create a simple service
cat > test-helper.pw << 'EOF'
agent test-helper
port 4000
llm anthropic claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022

expose greet@v1:
  params:
    name string
  returns:
    greeting string
  prompt_template:
    Create a friendly greeting for this person.
EOF

# 2. Generate and run
promptware generate test-helper.pw --yes
python3 test-helper_server.py &

# 3. Test it
python3 << 'PYTHON'
from promptware import call_verb
result = call_verb(
    service='test-helper',
    verb='greet@v1',
    params={'name': 'Dave'},
    address='http://localhost:4000'
)
print(result['greeting'])
PYTHON

# 4. Clean up
ps aux | grep test-helper | grep -v grep | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill
```

**Expected:** You'll see a friendly greeting generated by Claude.

## For Your Coding Agent

**Get the AI guide with one command:**

```bash
# Show the complete AI agent guide
promptware ai-guide

# Copy to clipboard (macOS)
promptware ai-guide | pbcopy

# Save to file
promptware ai-guide > guide.txt
```

**Then paste to your AI coding agent:**

```
I have Promptware installed. Here's the complete guide:

[paste output from `promptware ai-guide`]

Now help me build services for [your use case].
```

They'll understand everything and can help you build services.

## Next Steps (Your Choice)

**Option 1: Use it yourself first**
- Build 2-3 services for your coding needs
- See if it solves real problems
- Then decide about open sourcing

**Option 2: Test with AI agent**
- Pass them AI-AGENT-GUIDE.md
- Ask them to help you build a coding assistant
- See how well they understand it

**Option 3: Open source preparation**
- Try it for a week
- If useful, add MIT license
- Publish to GitHub
- Launch on HackerNews
